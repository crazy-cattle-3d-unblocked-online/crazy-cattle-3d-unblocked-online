## How to Play Crazy Cattle 3D Unblocked


### Controls

- WASD keys - Move your sheep
- Mouse - Control direction
- Spacebar - Activate special collisions
- Click game window to focus
- Press fullscreen button for better experience

### Movement Tips

- Build speed going downhill for powerful collisions
- Use small mouse adjustments rather than wild movements
- Time your spacebar hits exactly when about to collide with another sheep
- The higher ground in New Zealand gives a serious advantage (if you can stay on it)

### Common Rookie Mistakes

- Rushing into groups of sheep without momentum
- Forgetting that terrain affects movement (Iceland's volcanic areas slow you down)
- Overusing the spacebar - it needs a cooldown
- Missing the sweet spot for collisions (aim for their sides, not head-on)

### Map-Specific Strategies

- **Ireland:** Great for beginners with gentle hills and natural ramps. Perfect for practicing momentum.
- **Iceland:** Volcanic hazards are death traps. Use them to set up clever ambushes.
- **New Zealand:** Challenging mountainous terrain offers the most spectacular (and risky) plays.
